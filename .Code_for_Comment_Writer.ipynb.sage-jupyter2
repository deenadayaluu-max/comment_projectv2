The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.  A successful student will know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics.  A successful student will be able to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it.'\n\n\ndef reading_file(file_name):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by Taylor\n    Takes in a given file name and creates a\n    list of the informaton listed in the csv file\n    \"\"\"\n    things = []\n    with open(file_name) as file:\n        header = next(file)\n        data = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')\n        for info in data:\n            things.append(info)\n    return things\n\n\nDATA = reading_file('all_info2.csv')\n\n\ndef adjectives(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by Evie and Taylor\n    Takes in a student's name and returns a list of\n    the adjectives associated with that student.\n    \"\"\"\n    adj = student_info[2].split(', ')\n    adjectives = []\n    for word in adj:\n        adjectives.append(word)\n    return adjectives\n\n\ndef learning_outcomes():\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by everyone\n    Reads in the learning outcomes and\n    returns a dictionary of the outcome number and the outcome\n    \"\"\"\n    outcomes_dict = {}\n    with open('pythonlearningoutcomes.csv') as file:\n        header = next(file)\n        outcomes = csv.reader(file, delimiter=',')\n        counter = 1\n        for outcome in outcomes:\n            if counter not in outcomes_dict:\n                outcomes_dict[counter] = outcome[0]\n            counter += 1\n    return outcomes_dict\n\n\nOUTCOMES = learning_outcomes()\n\n\ndef strength_1(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by Uma\n    Organizes feedback according to information\n    gathered from the data about a student's strengths.\n    \"\"\"\n    outcome_num = int(student_info[3])\n    outcome_description = OUTCOMES[outcome_num]\n    comment = student_info[4]\n    return f\"Strength:\\nLearning Outcome {outcome_num} - {outcome_description}\\nComment: {comment}\"\n\n\ndef strength_2(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by Evie\n    Organizes feedback according to information\n    gathered from the data about a student's strengths.\n    \"\"\"\n    outcome_num = int(student_info[5])\n    outcome_description = OUTCOMES[outcome_num]\n    comment = student_info[6]\n    return f\"\\n\\nStrength:\\nLearning Outcome {outcome_num} - {outcome_description}\\nComment: {comment}\"\n\n\ndef area_of_growth(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by Taylor\n    Organizes feedback according to information\n    gathered from the data about a student's areas of growth.\n    \"\"\"\n    outcome_num = int(student_info[7])\n    outcome_description = OUTCOMES[outcome_num]\n    comment = student_info[8]\n    return f\"\\n\\nArea of Growth:\\nLearning Outcome {outcome_num} - {outcome_description}\\nComment: {comment}\"\n\n\ndef closing_section(student_info):\n    \"\"\"\n    Written by everyone\n    Based on the student's info, returns a closing section\n    about the student's overall performance in the class.\n    \"\"\"\n    ADJECTIVES = adjectives(student_info)\n    sentence = student_info[-1]\n    if len(ADJECTIVES) >= 2:\n        word1 = ADJECTIVES[0]\n        word2 = ADJECTIVES[1]\n        return f'\\n\\nClosing: {student_info[0].title()}!
