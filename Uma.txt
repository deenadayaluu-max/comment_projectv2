Course Name: Python II
This course builds on the skills and concepts learned in our previous computer science courses.  The topics challenge students to explore how computing and technology can impact the world, with a unique focus on creative problem solving and real-world applications.  A successful student will know more advanced data structures and object-oriented programming basics.  A successful student will be able to communicate with popular APIs including Twitter and Google in order to “grab” data and to organize the data and display it.
